  * Interface/abstract classes, concrete classes, driver classes, and resources.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open with a Java IDE.
3. Build & run following IDE instructions.

**Running Examples:**

* Driver classes (e.g., `Main.java`) demonstrate patterns.
* Run these classes to see patterns in action.
